## Background

#### What's a Protobuff?

From Google - https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/

> Protocol buffers are Google's language-neutral, platform-neutral,
> extensible mechanism for serializing structured data.


#### Why Protobuffs

Protocol Buffers are a way of encoding structured data in an efficient yet extensible format.

From Google - https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/overview

> Protocol buffers have many advantages over XML for serializing
> structured data. Protocol buffers are:
>
> -   simpler,
> -   3 to 10 times smaller,
> -   20 to 100 times faster,
> -   less ambiguous and
> -   generate data access classes that are easier to use programmatically

But the biggest benefit to Workstream is the interoperability offered by protobuffs. Protobuffs are implemented in a variety of languages and allow us to quickly generate code for you to interact and build upon the Workstream! No more figuring out some obscure language or having to learn snowflaked schemas.
